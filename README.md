## About

This repository collects my independent research work.  
Each document represents an exploration of a distinct subject, with conclusions drawn from verified data, logical reasoning, and transparent methodology.

My intent is to maintain **intellectual integrity**, **clarity**, and **objectivity** across all works, regardless of topic or potential bias.
